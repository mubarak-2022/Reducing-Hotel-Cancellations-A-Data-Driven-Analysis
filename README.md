## Overview

This project delves into the high cancellation rates faced by hotels by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings. Using Python and key data analysis libraries, we identified major factors influencing cancellations and provided actionable strategies for hotels to mitigate these issues and enhance revenue management.

## Business Problem

City and Resort Hotels have been grappling with high cancellation rates, which undermine revenue and room utilization. This study aims to offer data-driven recommendations to reduce cancellations and improve operational efficiency.

## Methodology

We analyzed a dataset of hotel bookings, including variables like booking lead time, average daily rate, and cancellation status. Key steps involved:

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data quality and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends and patterns.
- **Model Building:** Assessed factors influencing cancellations.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Assumptions

- Data from 2015 to 2017 is temporally consistent and relevant.
- Implemented strategies will not cause unforeseen negative outcomes.
- Hotels are not already using the proposed solutions.

## Research Questions

1. What factors impact hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can cancellation rates be improved?
3. How can this analysis assist in pricing and promotional decisions?

## Key Findings

- **Overall Cancellation Rates:** 37.91% of reservations were cancelled, with City Hotels showing higher absolute cancellations compared to Resort Hotels.
- **Price Sensitivity:** Higher average daily rates (ADR) correlate with increased cancellations.
- **Booking Channels:** Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) and group bookings exhibit higher cancellation rates compared to direct bookings.

## Graphical Insights

1. **Reservation Status Count:** Over 40,000 non-cancelled vs. 30,000 cancelled reservations.
2. **Hotel Type Analysis:** City Hotels experience more cancellations than Resort Hotels.
3. **Average Daily Rate Trends:** ADR increases have a direct impact on cancellation rates.
4. **Monthly Reservation Trends:** Highest cancellations in January, peak reservations in May and August.
5. **Top Countries for Cancellations:** Portugal leads with 68.59% of cancellations.

## Recommendations

1. **Refine Pricing Strategies:** Implement dynamic pricing and offer targeted discounts.
2. **Weekend and Holiday Discounts:** Adjust rates for high-cancellation periods.
3. **Marketing Campaigns:** Focus on high-cancellation months with targeted promotions.
4. **Enhance Quality and Service:** Improve facilities and guest experiences, especially in high-cancellation regions.
5. **Personalized Guest Experiences:** Use data to tailor services and enhance guest satisfaction.
6. **Flexible Booking Policies:** Offer flexible terms to reduce booking uncertainty.

By adopting these strategies, hotels can better manage cancellations, improve occupancy rates, and maximize revenue.
